# Private and group chat application with C# WPF.NET

## Description
Simple chat application using LAN with TCP/IP socket programming technology in C#. Application is a multi thread network application and works in a non-blocking way.
Both group and private messaging are also implemented in this code together with the ability to share relatively small files.

It is a single page application that serves both as a server and a client depending on the role the user wants instead of the formal seperate server and client applications.

For simplicity and demonstration purpose user authentication is simply handled with a simple xml file, which can be found [here](/Telecomms/assets/files/users.xml).
